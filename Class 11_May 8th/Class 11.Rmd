##PDB statistics 

Download CSV file from PDB database from <https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary>. Read this into R and determine fraction of X-ray structure 

```{r}
pdb.stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

Lets calculate something 
```{r}
percent <- (pdb.stats$Total/sum(pdb.stats$Total))*100
names(percent) <- pdb.stats$Experimental.Method
percent 
```
